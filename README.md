# Advent of Code 2025

Solutions for the Advent of Code 2025 in C++.

## Usage
Each `/Day#/` folder needs `input.txt` files for the given puzzles.

### Input text files
The `input.txt` files can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2025).

### Run
After cloning repo and `cd` into folder:
```bash
cd Day1
./build.sh
```
Use `chmod +x build.sh` if permission issues.


## Notes
Done in a UNIX environment. The `build.sh` probably won't work in Windows unless using `wsl`.
